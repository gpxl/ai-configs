# Task List Processing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides systematic instructions for managing and executing task lists during feature development. It ensures consistent progress tracking and quality implementation.

## Core Principles

### Sequential Execution
- **One sub-task at a time**: Do NOT start the next sub-task until receiving user permission
- **Ask before proceeding**: After each sub-task completion, ask "Ready for the next sub-task?" and wait for "yes" or "y"
- **Mandatory pause**: Stop after each sub-task for user approval

### Completion Protocol
1. **Mark sub-tasks complete**: Change `[ ]` to `[x]` immediately upon completion
2. **Mark parent tasks complete**: When ALL subtasks under a parent are `[x]`, mark the parent as `[x]`
3. **Update immediately**: Don't batch updates - mark complete as soon as finished

## Task List Maintenance

### Real-Time Updates
1. **Update task list file** after each significant work completion
2. **Add new tasks** as they emerge during implementation
3. **Modify tasks** if requirements change or issues arise
4. **Keep relevant files section current** with every file created or modified

### File Tracking
Maintain the "Relevant Files" section by:
- **Adding entries** for every file created or modified
- **Updating descriptions** to reflect actual implementation
- **Including test files** alongside implementation files
- **Noting purpose** in one-line descriptions

## Implementation Workflow

### Before Starting Work
1. **Review current task list** to identify next sub-task
2. **Check relevant files** section for context
3. **Understand parent task** context and goals
4. **Verify prerequisites** are completed

### During Implementation
1. **Follow TDD practices**: Write tests before implementation
2. **Implement incrementally**: Make small, verifiable progress
3. **Test frequently**: Ensure code works before proceeding
4. **Document decisions**: Update comments and documentation

### After Completing Sub-Task
1. **Test implementation**: Verify functionality works correctly
2. **Update task list**: Mark sub-task as complete `[x]`
3. **Update relevant files**: Add/modify entries as needed
4. **Ask for permission**: "Sub-task [X.X] completed. Ready for the next sub-task?"
5. **Wait for approval**: Do not proceed until user responds "yes" or "y"

## Quality Assurance

### Definition of "Complete"
A sub-task is only complete when:
- [ ] Implementation is fully functional
- [ ] All tests pass (unit and integration)
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Documentation is updated if needed
- [ ] No errors or warnings in development environment

### Pre-Completion Checklist
Before marking any sub-task complete:
- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] All relevant tests pass
- [ ] Implementation matches PRD requirements
- [ ] Code follows established patterns
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met (for UI components)

## Progress Tracking Template

### Task Status Updates
When updating task list, use this format:

```markdown
## Progress Update - [Date/Time]

### Completed:
- [x] X.X [Description of completed sub-task]

### Currently Working On:
- [ ] Y.Y [Description of current sub-task]

### Next Up:
- [ ] Z.Z [Description of next sub-task]

### Issues/Blockers:
- [Any obstacles or questions that arose]

### Files Modified:
- `path/to/file.tsx` - [What was changed/added]
- `path/to/file.test.tsx` - [Tests added/modified]
```

## Communication Guidelines

### Status Updates
After each sub-task, provide:
1. **Summary of work completed**
2. **Any issues encountered and how resolved**
3. **Updated task list with completion marked**
4. **Request for permission to continue**

### Example Status Communication
```
âœ… Sub-task 2.3 completed: Implemented user authentication form with validation

Changes made:
- Created `components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` with form handling
- Added `components/auth/LoginForm.test.tsx` with comprehensive tests
- Updated `types/auth.ts` with form validation schema

All tests passing. Ready for the next sub-task (2.4: Add error handling)?
```

### When Blocked
If encountering issues:
1. **Describe the problem** clearly
2. **Explain what was attempted**
3. **Ask specific questions** for guidance
4. **Suggest potential solutions** if possible
5. **Wait for guidance** before proceeding

## Error Handling

### When Tests Fail
1. **Stop implementation** immediately
2. **Analyze test failures** and root causes
3. **Fix issues** before proceeding
4. **Re-run all tests** to ensure no regressions
5. **Update task list** only after all tests pass

### When Requirements Change
1. **Pause current work** and assess impact
2. **Update task list** to reflect changes
3. **Modify relevant files** section as needed
4. **Get user confirmation** on updated approach
5. **Resume work** only after approval

## Documentation Updates

### Continuous Documentation
- **Update README** if public interfaces change
- **Add JSDoc comments** for complex functions
- **Update type definitions** when data structures change
- **Note architectural decisions** in relevant files

### End-of-Task Documentation
When all tasks under a parent are complete:
1. **Update project documentation** with new feature
2. **Run code index generator**: `node code_index_generator.js`
3. **Update task list** with final status
4. **Summarize implementation** for future reference

## Final Guidelines

### Never Proceed Without Permission
- **Always ask** before starting next sub-task
- **Wait for explicit approval** ("yes" or "y")
- **Respect user's pace** and review needs
- **Provide clear status** for informed decision-making

### Maintain Quality Standards
- **No shortcuts** on testing or documentation
- **Follow project conventions** consistently
- **Ensure accessibility** for user-facing components
- **Keep code clean and maintainable**
